Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They
want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product
offerings and reach in the financial market.

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and
approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However,
strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr.Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them
to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing them the full project.
They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their
online spend and other details.
